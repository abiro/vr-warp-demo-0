# 3D warping for VR demo

This is a preliminary demo for an ongoing project that aims to speed up VR rendering up to 50% by rendering images for one eye with 3D warping (read more [here](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp/wiki)). The purpose of this demo is to provide an initial implementation for 3D warping. This demo is not compatible with VR-devices, it simply renders two images side-by-side to the window buffer. It is still work in progress, as the warping procedure suffers from several [issues.](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp/wiki/Bugs) For the steps after fixing these, see the [road map.](https://github.com/abiro/vr-warp/wiki/Road-map)
